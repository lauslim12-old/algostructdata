# Algorithms and Data Structures
My laboratory works/assignments for Algorithms and Data Structures. This whole repository was coded with C and written in Indonesian language. Feel free to take inspiration from any of my assignments.

# Architecture / Philosophies
* C Programming Language
* Minimal amount of frameworks (simple programs)
* Usage of arrays and/or pointers

# Program Descriptions
* Week 2 consists of making a 3D-shape volume and area calculator. The results are then stored in a structure which you can call anytime with the history function. Featuring usage of pointers, and structures.
* Week 3 consists of two programs. The first program is a text transformator program that swaps the lowercase sentences to uppercase sentences, uppercase to lowercase sentences, and a switch function that transforms lowercase into uppercase and vice versa. The second program is a 3x3 matrix calculator. This program can multiply, add, and transpose two 3x3 matrices.
* Week 4 consists of three programs. First program is text-trasformator with memory allocation, second program is a matrix calculator with memory allocation. The final and 'big' program is a system/program to rent a room. Rent-a-room is a program which uses Single Linked Lists as its main lifeblood. You can use this program to borrow rooms, delete already borrowed rooms (for now, only deleting all is possible), and display all borrowed rooms. This program illustrates the concepts of adding, deleting, and displaying the contents of Single Linked Lists. Another feature is that you cannot borrow a room which has already been borrowed by someone else. The algorithm for not being able to borrow already borrowed room feature is quite simple but it takes time to wrap your head around it (I've been there too).

# Installations and Usage
Copy or download the code into your Integrated Developer Environment of your choice, then build and run it. It is as simple as that.

# Contribution
If you have any ideas on how to improve the algorithms, feel free to submit a pull request.

# Algorithms and Data Structures
My laboratory works/assignments for Algorithms and Data Structures. This whole repository was coded with C and written in Indonesian language. Feel free to take inspiration from any of my assignments.

# Architecture / Philosophies
* C Programming Language
* Minimal amount of frameworks (simple programs)
* Usage of arrays and/or pointers

# Program Descriptions
* Week 2 consists of making a 3D-shape volume and area calculator. The results are then stored in a structure which you can call anytime with the history function. Featuring usage of pointers, and structures.
* Week 3 consists of two programs. The first program is a text transformator program that swaps the lowercase sentences to uppercase sentences, uppercase to lowercase sentences, and a switch function that transforms lowercase into uppercase and vice versa. The second program is a 3x3 matrix calculator. This program can multiply, add, and transpose two 3x3 matrices.
